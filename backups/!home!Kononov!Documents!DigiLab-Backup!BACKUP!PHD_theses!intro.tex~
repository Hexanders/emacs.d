\label{ch:intro}
The development in the industry and the research in the science in moment strive in the direction of smaller and smaller layer systems like e.g. CPU with 7nm schciht diche of the computing structures ....

In the present work the combination of a nanostructured surface of an oxide film (grown on ni3Al111 crystal) and two different adsorbate materials: fullerene (C60) and bismuth were investigated. Where the latter forms clusters due to the nanostructure of the substrate. The investigations were carried out with three methods STM, UPS and LEED. The latter method was used only to verify the wuality of the substrate and to determine more precisely the amount of bismuth deposited.
